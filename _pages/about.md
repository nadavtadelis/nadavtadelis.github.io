I'm a Senior Economist in the Office of the Chief Economist at Microsoft. As an Economics PhD candidate at UC Berkeley, I focused on industrial organization and econometrics. In the Fall of my fifth year, I made the strategic decision to take a leave of absence from the doctorate program and defer graduation. This has allowed me to explore industry while considering a future in academia, with my current focus fully dedicated to excelling in my role at Microsoft and continuing to publish research. My specific interests include causal machine learning, dynamic auctions, matching markets, learning-by-doing, productivity dynamics, and heterogeneous treatment effects in high dimensional settings.

In my spare time you might find me backpacking (Emigrant Wilderness is a favorite), cooking, or stuck in traffic trying to get to Kirkwood.
