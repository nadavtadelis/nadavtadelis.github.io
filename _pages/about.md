I'm a 5'th year Economics PhD candidate at UC Berkeley, focusing on industrial organization and econometrics. My specific interests include learning-by-doing, productivity dynamics, matching markets, dynamic auctions, causal machine learning, and heterogeneous treatment effects in high dimensional settings.

In my spare time you might find me backpacking (Emigrant Wilderness is a favorite), cooking, or stuck in traffic trying to get to Kirkwood.
